The [second Release Candidate of FW/1 3.5.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-rc2) is available for testing.

This Release Candidate contains a few bug fixes discovered since Release Candidate 1.
I consider this stable enough to evaluate for production usage at this point -- I expect this RC to be the Gold Release unless end user testing uncovers a showstopping issue in the next week or two!

You can read the [full list of changes since 3.1](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.5+is%3Aclosed) on GitHub, along with
