The [first Beta release of FW/1 3.5.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-beta1) is available for testing.

The focus of this release is integration:<!--more-->

* Support for controllers and services to be written in CFML (`.cfc`), Clojure (`.clj`), or Lucee (`.lucee`)
* Support for views and layouts to be written in CFML (`.cfm`) or Lucee (`.lucee`)
* Configurable folder names to set your own conventions (for _controllers_, _layouts_, _subsystems_, and _views_)
* Support for `Application.cfc` to use FW/1 without extending `framework.one`
* A new, cleaner, more consistent set of conventions for adding subsystems to an existing application

You can read the [full list of changes since 3.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.5+is%3Aclosed) on GitHub.

The [documentation for 3.5](/documentation/3.5/) has been completely overhauled with complete descriptions of all the new features, as well as many
clarifications and expansions of existing features. In particular, you'll want to check out:
