Framework One version 2.2 is now available for production use! You can download it from the [Framework One page on RIAForge](http://fw1.riaforge.org/). This includes one bug fix over RC2 (interaction between `renderData()` and trace output).<!-- more -->

The main focus of the 2.2 release is improved support for REST APIs, through the addition of `renderData()` to simplify returning JSON, XML and plain text results to the caller, as well as more sophisticated route handling via "resource packs" which let you define a family of related routes for a given resource type, using a shorthand notation. For more information, see this [blog post about the latest FW/1 release and the roadmap](/blog/2013/11/03/fw1-releases-and-roadmap/).

As noted previously, the master branch is the current stable release (2.2), and the develop branch has become the next release (2.5). 2.5 will be released next month and will be a stepping stone toward some substantial changes coming in 3.0. For more detail, read this [blog post explaining the changes coming in 2.5 and 3.0](/blog/2013/11/02/fw1-the-year-ahead).
