After two years in the CFML world, FW/1 (Framework One) comes to Clojure!<!-- more -->

Intended to bring the same simple, lightweight, convention-based MVC web application development that has proved so popular in the CFML world to the world of Clojure, [FW/1 for Clojure](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-clj) is available on Clojars (0.1.0, as of April 2012). If you clone the github repo, you'll see a "user manager" example application which is a port of the same app from the CFML version of the framework. The documentation is, as always, a work in progress but covers the basic API and how to create a driver program for the framework in Clojure. More information on the rationale, approach and API of FW/1 can be found on the [FW/1 (for CFML) wiki](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/wiki). I plan to adapt this for the Clojure version shortly...
