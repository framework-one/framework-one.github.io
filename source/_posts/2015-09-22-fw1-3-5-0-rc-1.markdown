The [first Release Candidate of FW/1 3.5.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-rc1) is available for testing.

This Release Candidate contains just bug fixes since Beta 2. Beta 2 contained mostly bug fixes since Beta 1, with one small enhancement to DI/1 (`liberal` plural support, e.g., `libraries` becomes `library`).

You can read the [full list of changes since 3.1](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.5+is%3Aclosed) on GitHub.
