[FW/1 4.0.0 Alpha 1](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha1) is available. At this point FW/1 4.0.0 is feature complete -- there may be a few very minor changes between now and the Beta, and then only bug fixes through the RC phase. We've been using this **develop** version in production at work all along so I consider it solid enough for serious work.<!-- more -->

The focus of the 4.0 release is on improving REST support. Improvements include:

* JSON-encoded POST body support.
* Controllers have easy access to HTTP headers.
* Builder syntax for `renderData()` result elements.
* Support for user-supplied rendering functions.
* Integrated support for HTTP `OPTIONS` verb.
* Per-resource error handling.
* Setting status text (in addition to status code) in HTTP responses.
* Wildcard HTTP method support.

In addition, DI/1 has had a number of enhancements, including the addition of a builder syntax for programmatically declaring beans.
