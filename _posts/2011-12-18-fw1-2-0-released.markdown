After a long period of testing out in the wild FW/1 2.0 reached RC2 back in October and no further bugs have been reported. Only documentation remained and that has now been completed. FW/1 2.0 is gold and can be downloaded from [FW/1's GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases). Happy Holidays!
