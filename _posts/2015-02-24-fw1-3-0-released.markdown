I'm pleased to announce that after lots of user testing and almost no issues found, the Gold Release of [FW/1 3.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0) is now available!<!-- more -->

About two and a half weeks ago I released [FW/1 3.0 RC 2](http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/02/06/fw1-3-0-rc-2-available/) and only one minor issue was reported (an inconsistency between `buildURL()` and `buildCustomURL()` regarding how `baseURL` was handled). That has been fixed, along with the addition of a new extension point for DI/1 (`metadata()`).

You can see a [full list of issues fixed in FW/1 for 3.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=13&q=is%3Aclosed) and a [full list of issues fixed in DI/1 1.0](https://github.com/framework-one/di1/issues?milestone=1&q=is%3Aclosed) on GitHub. This represents the official release of DI/1 1.0 as well.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the 3.0 release - it's been a long time in the making! Particular thanks go to Nando Breiter for migrating the DI/1 documentation from the old wiki to the new FW/1 website. Also thanks to John Berquist, Ryan Guill, Cameron Childress, and Adam Tuttle for you code contributions and everyone who tested prerelease builds of FW/1 and reported issues and made suggestions! Thank you!
