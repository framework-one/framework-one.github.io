The thread safety issue affecting SES URLs and routes in FW/1 3.0 has been backported to the 2.2.x and 2.5.x releases so if you believe you are seeing incorrectly routed requests on either of those releases, you can update to the appropriate patch release:

* [download FW/1 2.5.2](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v2.5.2) to replace Release 2.5.1 or 2.5
* [download FW/1 2.2.3](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v2.2.3) to replace Release 2.2.2, 2.2.1 or 2.2

These include a context root fix for 2.5.1 and 2.2.2.

If you are on an earlier release of FW/1 and believe you are seeing the issue that is fixed in this patch, please post on the FW/1 mailing list (I'd rather not backport this patch any further -- I'd rather you upgraded!).

Once again, thank you to David Sede√±o who highlighted this critical issue!
