[FW/1 4.0.0 Beta 2](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta2) is available.
The only change from Beta 1 is that the `enableJSONPOST` setting has been renamed to `decodeRequestBody`.
This is a **breaking change** if you were using that setting in the earlier Alpha / Beta builds:
you will now get an exception and will need to update your application's configuration.

For full details, read the [Change Log for FW/1 4.0](http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/4.0/changes.html).
