[FW/1 4.1.0](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.1.0) has been released!

This is a maintenance release for FW/1 4.0.0 that includes a number of bug fixes and some minor enhancements. See this [blog post about the release candidate](http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2017/06/16/fw1-4-1-0-rc1/) for the main changes in this release. Since the release candidate, most of the work has been on updating the documentation and adding an example of using a custom template engine (Mustache) with FW/1.

Note that 4.1.0 includes an important bug fix for 4.0.0 which addresses a race condition that could cause transient beans to be partially resolved, leading to dependencies not being available under heavy load conditions.

Lucee 5.x is now an officially supported platform for FW/1, along with Adobe ColdFusion 10, 11, and 2016, and Lucee 4.5.
