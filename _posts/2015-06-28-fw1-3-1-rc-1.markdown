The first Release Candidate of FW/1 3.1 is now available for testing. You [download FW/1 3.1 RC 1 from GitHub](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1-rc1).

These are the changes since Beta 2:

* `renderData()` supports `"jsonp"` (Giancarlo Gomez) and `"html"`.
* `renderData()` now causes a content reset before rendering the data (Giancarlo Gomez).
* Subsystem-specific configuration can now override `diEngine`, `diLocations`, and `diComponent`. Previously it could only override `diConfig`.
* `setupApplication()` no longer runs twice when first request is also a reload request.

For a complete list of changes since 3.0:

* [Issues Closed](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.1)
* [Pull Requests Merged](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.1)

At this point, release 3.1 is "feature complete" and only bug fixes will be included between now and the "gold" release. Release 3.5 will follow fairly quickly after that, with a focus on language integration, bringing
automatic support for Clojure code in the Model and Controllers, as well as first class support for the Lucee Language in the Model, the Views, and the Controllers.
