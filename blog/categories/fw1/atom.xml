    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.1.0">FW/1 4.1.0</a> has been released!</p>

<p>This is a maintenance release for FW/1 4.0.0 that includes a number of bug fixes and some minor enhancements. See this <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2017/06/16/fw1-4-1-0-rc1/">blog post about the release candidate</a> for the main changes in this release. Since the release candidate, most of the work has been on updating the documentation and adding an example of using a custom template engine (Mustache) with FW/1.</p>

<p>Note that 4.1.0 includes an important bug fix for 4.0.0 which addresses a race condition that could cause transient beans to be partially resolved, leading to dependencies not being available under heavy load conditions.</p>

<p>Lucee 5.x is now an officially supported platform for FW/1, along with Adobe ColdFusion 10, 11, and 2016, and Lucee 4.5.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.1.0-rc1">Release Candidate of FW/1 4.1.0</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>This is a maintenance release for FW/1 4.0.0 that includes a number of bug fixes and some minor enhancements. The most important bug fix addresses a race condition that could cause transient beans to be partially resolved, leading to dependencies not being available under heavy load conditions. My thanks to <a href="https://github.com/aliaspooryorik">John Whish</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jcberquist">John Berquist</a> for their work in tracking that down and providing a patch to address it!</p>

<p>Other bug fixes mostly focus on error handling.</p>

<p>The enhancements include making session handling pluggable, improving handling of missing views, and a new <code>onReload()</code> extension point. In addition, the process to test FW/1 has been overhauled: it now uses CommandBox and TestBox, making it much easier for contributors to run tests locally, as well as expanding the matrix of servers/versions that can be automatically tested.</p>

<p>Finally, Lucee 5.x is officially supported by this release. Although earlier versions of FW/1 “worked” on Lucee 5.x, the Clojure integration (introduced in FW/1 3.5) only worked in limited cases on Lucee 5.x so I could not consider it “officially supported” (for example, at World Singles, we could not upgrade to Lucee 5.x because it breaks our use of Clojure from CFML). In order to support Lucee 5.x officially, the Clojure integration functionality has been removed from FW/1. The files that provide Clojure integration are still available in the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/cfmljure">cfmljure repository</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>I consider this Release Candidate to be “production-ready” so I would appreciate as many users upgrading and testing it as possible!</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who contributes to FW/1 in every way!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.0.0">Gold Release of FW/1 4.0.0</a> is available for general release and production use. The focus of this release is improved REST support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSON-encoded and URL-encoded POST / PUT body support.</li>
  <li>Controllers have easy access to HTTP headers.</li>
  <li>Builder syntax for <code>renderData()</code> result elements.</li>
  <li>Support for user-supplied rendering functions.</li>
  <li>Integrated support for HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> verb.</li>
  <li>Per-resource error handling.</li>
  <li>Setting status text (in addition to status code) in HTTP responses.</li>
  <li>Wildcard HTTP method support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependency Injection (DI/1) has also received a lot of attention in this release, including the addition of a flexible and powerful builder syntax for declaring beans.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/4.0/changes.html">FW/1 4.0.0 Change Log</a> for full details of all the enhancements and bug fixes. Please note that there are a few breaking (or potentially breaking) changes since 3.5.1, with the most notable one being that Adobe ColdFusion 10 is now the minimum supported version. Support for Railo and Lucee has not changed.</p>

<p>This will be followed by a 4.1 maintenance release and a 4.5 migration release, which will pave the way for some breaking changes planned for the 5.0 release. For more details of future plans, consult the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/roadmap.html">FW/1 Roadmap</a>.</p>
