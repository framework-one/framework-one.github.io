		 <p>FW/1 was created in July 2009 as a reaction against complexity and bloat in other frameworks in the CFML community. FW/1 itself is a single file, and provides a simple, convention-based approach to MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications, as well as REST APIs. Whilst it has become more sophisticated over time, it has remained a single file, focused on getting out of your way and providing the intuitive plumbing you need. For historical background, you can read the <a href="/blog/2009/07/19/introducing-framework-one/">introductory blog post</a> from July 2009.</p>

<p>As of release 3.1, FW/1 also includes DI/1 - a simple, convention-based Dependency Injection framework - and AOP/1 - a simple, convention-based Aspect-Oriented Programming framework. If those phrases don’t mean anything to you, don’t worry, you won’t need to know anything about them to get started.
