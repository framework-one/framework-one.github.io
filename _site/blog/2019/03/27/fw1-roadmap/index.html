<p>After seeing this blog post, <a href="https://github.com/sneiland">Steven Neiland</a> stepped up to take over maintenance of the framework! He has been a long-time user of FW/1 and designed the “2.0” version of subsystems four years ago. I’m looking forward to working with Steven to ensure a smooth hand-off over the next few months. Thank you!</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-fw1-union">State of the FW/1 Union</h2>

<p>It’s been a year now since <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v4.2.0">FW/1 4.2.0</a> was released so I wanted to revisit the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/4.2/roadmap.html">roadmap document</a> from that time. At the end of December 2018, I posted to the FW/1 channel on the CFML Slack (and to the FW/1 mailing list) that my involvement with CFML and FW/1 was coming to an end. I’ve asked, several times over the years, for new maintainers to step up for FW/1. Nolan Erck has permissions on the GitHub organization (as owner) but I’m not expecting him to lead development as he has a lot of other things on his plate. At this point, FW/1 is extremely stable and (fairly) well-documented. 4.0.0 was released in Fall 2016. There have been (minor) maintenance releases each year since (4.1.0 in July ‘17 and 4.2.0 at the end of March ‘18).</p>

<p>There have been two very small enhancements on the develop branch since then (thank you Carl Von Stetten and Matthew Clemente) but not enough to warrant a new release (and, with CommandBox, it’s easy enough to install that branch anyway: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">box install fw1@be</code>). At this point, unless one or more genuinely proactive and engaged maintainers come forward, 4.2.0 will probably be the last official release of the framework.</p>

<h2 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h2>

<p>The roadmap document (linked above) talks about a refactoring of the lifecycle functionality that was intended to simplify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Application.cfc</code> and the “Alternative Application Structure” in current FW/1 apps but it would ultimately have been a significant breaking change (hence the mention of an intermediate 4.5 migration release before the breaking 5.0 release). Since that was mostly driven by my architectural preferences, I don’t see any value in any new maintainers following that path – I never fleshed out, on paper, what that should look like so I’m going to close out the associated GitHub issue for it. Making subsystems more self-contained and more “pluggable” probably should be a goal for any new maintainers, but tackled more incrementally. Beyond that, I don’t know what should be on a roadmap now: perhaps minimal, careful maintenance to fix bugs and stay compatible with new versions of Lucee and Adobe ColdFusion is all that is really needed?</p>

<h2 id="my-road-to-here">My Road to Here</h2>

<p>I’ve made no secret of how my work has transitioned from CFML to Clojure over the last roughly nine years. I initially ported FW/1 to Clojure but then decided to sunset that port, as it became clear that FW/1 added very little value to a (simpler) combination of the Ring, Compojure, Component, and Selmer libraries. At work, we ported our CFML FW/1 apps to Clojure FW/1 apps and then to plain Clojure apps a few years ago. Our primary CFML app – built with ColdBox – was retired completely this month, in favor of a React.js-based front end and a Clojure-based back end. We have two ColdBox apps remaining: a small, customer-facing app that we plan to redesign and rebuild (in Clojure) over the next year, and a medium-sized internal “administration” app that we started migrating to Clojure last year. We’ve gone from four servers running Lucee to just one, and expect to retire that before year end.</p>

<p>I got started with CFML over seventeen years ago, when my then-employer Macromedia acquired Allaire, and as a technology it has been good to me throughout that time – at Macromedia, at Adobe, as a freelancer, at Broadchoice (Flex, Groovy, and Railo), as part of Railo Inc, as a freelancer again, and for several years at <a href="https://worldsinglesnetworks.com">World Singles Networks</a> where I also found myself writing Scala for a year or so and then Clojure. The CFML community is one of the friendliest, most supportive technology groups I’ve met, in a career that spans back to the early 80’s, and I’ve missed seeing my CFML friends at conferences as my work focus has shifted – it’s been six years now since I last attended a CFML conference!</p>

<p>I expect I’ll still lurk on the CFML Slack for quite a while, and I’ll stay subscribed to the FW/1 mailing list – forever, I expect – so folks can still reach me for FW/1 and CFML questions and general chit-chat.</p>
