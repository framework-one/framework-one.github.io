	<p>I mentioned it in passing in one of my early posts about using Clojure from CFML but, since only one person signed up, thought it was worth mentioning again: there is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfmljure">mailing list for cfmljure</a> where you can ask questions about the project and Clojure itself or, if you’re new to CFML and coming from the Clojure world, you can ask questions about CFML!</p>

<p>I’m planning to add a couple of more involved examples to the project repo, one of which will use FW/1 and have the entire Model built in Clojure with the View-Controller portion written in CFML / cfscript - and I’m also planning to create a simple ready-to-run Jetty-based package so folks can simply download cfmljure and try it out without needing to worry about installing anything.</p>

<p>You can always get the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/cfmljure/releases">latest version of cfmljure from GitHub</a>!</p>
