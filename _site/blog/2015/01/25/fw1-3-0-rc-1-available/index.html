	<p>FW/1 3.0 has been in beta testing since August 2014 and lots of people are already running in production so I figured it was time to push out the first <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0-rc1">Release Candidate build</a>.</p>

<p>The main focus of RC 1 has been bug fixes. Only a small number of functional enhancements have been added (notably <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getEnvVar()</code> to retrieve the value of a system environment variable which can be useful during environment control processing).<!-- more --> Some deprecated features have been removed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getRC()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getRCValue()</code> have been removed, along with the configuration flag that had been enabling them. They were a hasty addition at the end of the 2.5 cycle and they were a mistake - if you’re using them, you’re doing something wrong!</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.corfield.framework</code> is no longer supported - use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">framework.one</code> instead. It was always a questionable choice of file path for the framework and I’ve been tempted to change it several times. The 3.0 cycle deprecated it and moved the framework CFC to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/framework</code> folder, where DI/1 has lived since the 2.5 cycle. This is probably a <strong>breaking change</strong> unless you’ve been using prerelease builds of 3.0 and have already eliminated the deprecation warnings!</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, AOP/1 is no longer bundled with FW/1. It’s not ready for primetime yet so I didn’t want to include it in the 3.0 release. It got a lot of work between Alpha 1 and Beta 1 but additional bugs and some hard problems came up in testing. It’s still available on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aop1</code> branch if you want to experiment with it (and help find and fix more bugs in it!).</p>

<p>As part of the preparation for RC 1, all of the documentation has been reviewed and updated and DI/1’s documentation is now <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/using-di-one.html">part of the main documentation site</a>. Big thanks go to Nando Breiter for bringing that across from the old wiki in the standalone DI/1 repo. Code contributors to RC 1 include: John Berquist, Ryan Guill, Cameron Childress. Thank you!</p>

<p>At this point, only bug fixes will be considered before FW/1 3.0 goes “gold” and given the long period of testing so far on Beta 1, that final release shouldn’t be too far away.</p>
